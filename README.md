### About me
Hi, I’m currently a Software Tester Intern at Bangkok Bank and a student at Chiang Mai University, majoring in Modern Management and Information Technology. I live in Bangkok, Thailand. 

I have a strong passion for exploring science, technology, and finance. My key interests lie in machine learning, secure system design, and building efficient, scalable solutions—especially those that enhance the reliability and safety of financial platforms.

I’m always looking for opportunities to grow my skills in AI/ML development, cybersecurity, and fintech innovation, and to collaborate with like-minded professionals passionate about building the future of technology.
